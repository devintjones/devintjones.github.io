## Generative models
* Data follows a distribution function theta (posterior)
* Theta drawn from a distrubtion phi (phi determined by 'god')

Folk theorm: if its hard to compute, its a bad model

## Inference
* Simulate theta 
* Post processing
* Does inferenc emake sense? 
	* do the results align with your prior belief?
