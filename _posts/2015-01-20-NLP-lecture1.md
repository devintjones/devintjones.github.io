# NLP lecture 1

Instructor: Dragomir Ranev
office hours before class. Office seps 627

## Course Intro
### 2001 Space Odessey
Reference to space odessey 2001. HAL is a computer that is in charge of everything. It has a natural language interface. (HAL is one letter off of "IBM")

### IBM Watson

### What is Natural Langugage Processing
The study of computation treatment of natural (human) lanaguage

Computers don't understand language, so we have to teach them

### Modern Applicatoins
* Search enginges
	* Google search
* Question answering
	* IBM Watson
* Natural langugae assistants
	* Appli Siri
* Translation systems
	* Google Translate
* News digest
* Automated earthquake reports
	* LA times
* Automated stock market reports

### Notes
Computers are ocnfused by human language
-> specific techniques are needed, such as
* linguistics
* theoretical CS
* mathematics
* statistics
* AI
* psychoclogy
* DBs

Goals of this class:
* understand that langugage process is hard (and why)
* understand key problems in nlp
* learn about methods used
* understand limitations
